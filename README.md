## 🫁 Overview

**LungVision** is a deep learning-powered web application built using Flask that detects Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it classifies images as TB-positive or TB-negative, assisting in early diagnosis with an accessible, user-friendly interface.
